                    <p>
                        Access points are locations of interest in our database that people
                        in need may find useful. These access points may include locations with 
                        free internet, computer access, study spaces, and much more! 
                    </p>

                    <h4><b>How do I find an access point?</b></h4>
                        <p>
                            Finding an access point is simple: press the button below to find
                            a table of all the access points in our database. From there, you can
                            search and sort the table to find access points near you!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our database depends on user feedback: if you know about an access
                            point in your region or would like use to add more points for your location,
                            send us a <a href="suggestion.php">suggestion.</a>

                        Do you want to reduce inequalities, but don't know how to help or where to begin?
                        Public Information has compiled a <a href="how-to-help.php">quick guide</a> on how to help reduce inequalities, 
                        along with a few more resources.

                            While being an active member in your community is one way to help others, this is not
                            the only way. If you have money to spare, there are many organizations that accept donations.
                            We have created a short list of organizations that are dedicated to reducing inequality.
                            Don't stop there, of course; there are many other organizations out there.
